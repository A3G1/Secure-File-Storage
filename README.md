# Secure-File-Storage
Secure File Storage on Cloud using Hybrid Cryptography:
Cryptography can be defined as an art of encoding and decoding the patterns (in the form of messages).
In Cryptography the techniques which are use to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode it. These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions.

Hybrid Algorithms for the cryptography are effective and so, it is not very easy to detect the pattern and decode the message. Here, the algorithm is a combination of mathematical function and Caesar Cipher, so as to implement Hybrid Cryptography Algorithm.
